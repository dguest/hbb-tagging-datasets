Dataset Meta Lookup for H->bb Tagging
=====================================

These are scripts to use ami to find metadata on the H->bb tagging
samples. They work sometimes.

To use
------

Type `get-dataset-info.sh {datasets,dijet_datasets}.txt`

You can also rebuild the dataset lists with `get-*-datasets.sh`, but
these don't really work very well right now.
